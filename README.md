# Product-Anomaly-Detection-System-using-Teachable-Machine
Objective

The goal of this project was to create an interactive product inspection system that uses machine learning to detect anomalies or defects in manufactured items. The user interface is built using Streamlit, while the backend uses a TensorFlow model trained with Teachable Machine.
